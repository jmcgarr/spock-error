Example spock-error 
===========

While authoring some spock tests, I noticed that a certain syntax in my test would pass just fine if the conditions were met, but would throw an exception if the test condition was not met.  I am using this project to isolate the error conditions. 

To replicate the errors, just clone this repo and run:

```
./gradlew test
```
